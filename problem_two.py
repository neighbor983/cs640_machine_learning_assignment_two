2. You are given training patterns {X1,, .  .  .  .  , XN}  from two classes. 
All patterns are augmented by 1 and patterns of Class-2 are multiplied by -1 as 
discussed in the class. 

The cost function J(θ) = ∑I = 1 to N (1/Xi tXi) [|θtXi|2-|θtXi|θtXi] attains 
its only minimum value of zero if θtXi  > 0 for all Xi. 

Develop a machine learning algorithm based on gradient descent approach and the 
above cost function to learn θ from training data to separate the two classes.
